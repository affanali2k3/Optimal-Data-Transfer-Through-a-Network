# Optimal-Data-Transfer-Through-a-Network
Working:

This project is made using graphs data structures and its purpose is to check the most optimal path between two graph nodes. In our case we have a map of routers forming a whole network. To send a signal between one router to another it needs to be transferred through a short path so that the data is quickly sent.

Data Structures Used:

The following data structures are used in this project:

Graphs

Queue

Vector

Hash Table
